# Programming - Principles and Practice Using C++ 
I learned a big part of programming along with this awesome book. <br><br>
The code in this repository may be ugly and not complete, but I will leave it here for the case someone needs a little hint on some of the exercises I have done. <br><br>
If you are new to C++ you will find a good documentation here: <br>
http://en.cppreference.com/w/
<br><br>
and if you are in the last chapters you will love the talks of the CppCon:<br>
